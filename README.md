This is going to be a two day project to help you learn CSS, and produce your
own, custom CSS framework that you can use for your future projects.

A CSS framework provides you with boilerplate CSS that allows you to quickly style
a project. We're going to create our own CSS framework, but it's important to recognize
that there are popular, robust, open source CSS frameworks that you can use if you want.
Bootstrap, which was created by Twitter, is one of the most popular HTML/CSS frameworks.
Angular Material is a UI framework built by Google based on Material Design, and built
for Angular.
